This subdirectory of Project 3 (Project3_add) contains several files that were
generated while successfully completing Udacity's Robotic Nanodegree 
Perception module (lesson 5 Object Recognition parts 1 - 17):

model.sav is the file that correctly discriminates all table objects into
their correct categories

oldmodel.sav is the predecessor file that poorly discriminated table objects

object_recognition.py is an additional back up of the file present in 
the Project 3b folder
